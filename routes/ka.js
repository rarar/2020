  res.locals.problemStatement = "<p>Imagine this: Mrs. Espinoza is a 4th grade teacher in an inner-city school district in Clark County, Nevada. She‚Äôs got a class size of 40, and even though her school is common-core aligned, not every student is at a 4th grade level when it comes to Math and English Language Arts (ELA). In fact, the range is quite broad‚Äîsome students are working at a 2nd grade level while others might be at a 6th grade level. How can she ensure to meet the needs of every student so that they can live up to their full learning potential?</p><p>This short anecdote is the reality of our school system today. In the past handful of years, we‚Äôve seen class sizes increase as well as the gap in student ability. At the same time, teacher turnover rates in public schools are hitting new highs. How might we use technology in the classroom to better help teachers personalize the education experience for learners so that they can live up to their potential? This question sparked the inception for a new product between the non-profits NWEA and Khan Academy that I led the design for.</p><p><a href=\"http://nwea.org\">NWEA</a> is a research-driven non-profit that creates one of the most prevalent assessments for students in grades 3‚Äì8. This assessment, called MAP Growth, is typically administered 3x per year and covers Math and ELA. MAP allows schools and teachers to assess students for growth and help them differentiate and adjust instruction for the ways material is taught in classes.</p><p>While MAP Growth is definitely helpful, teachers and school districts without a lot of resources are caught in a tough situation: they know the needs of their students but they don‚Äôt have the time and the means to offer them personalized help. This gap in the public school system served as fertile ground for a partnership to form between Khan Academy, an online platform for personalized practice in foundational skills, and NWEA. Together, we started asking the following questions:</p><ul class='inner-content'><li>How might we help learners get the personalized practice they need to live up to their potential?</li><li>How might we help teachers differentiate instruction without unnecessary friction?</li><li>How might we help school districts integrate rosters and MAP Growth scores and then monitor progress?</li></ul><section class='jumbo'><div class='img-container full'><img src='/images/map-research.png' /></div><div class='detail'><p>Our team running a participatory design research session with a class in the Chicago Public School system.</p></div></section>";
  res.locals.processSolution = "<p>The team targeted to have an alpha release ready for back-to-school 2019, and we agreed that the bulk of the experience would rest on the teachers. Our end goal was to have a pilot product called MAP Accelerator that 5 districts across the country would use. While this product included roles for district leaders, teachers and students, the district leader experience relied largely on a subset of the teacher experience and the student experience relied heavily on the existing Khan Academy learner experience. As Principal Designer, my role was to lead the end-to-end product design effort for the overarching teacher experience. It was a lot of work, but I‚Äôll try to succinctly outline the steps.</p><h4>Defining the constraints</h4><p>We were under a really tight timeline and a brand new user base. While Khan Academy has worked with teachers before, teachers using the MAP test was an entirely new demographic! When we started collecting information on these teachers, we realized that they were all so very different. Diving into the data, my Product Manager and I decided it would be inefficient to craft personas but rather we should focus on the market segment we wanted to tackle: <em>teachers with less than 5 years of experience who are new to MAP</em>. Defining these user constraints, helped my team and I design for these teachers‚Äô specific needs.</p><p>The technical & business side presented a hurdle that we also had to design around: rostering students would be a manual process between NWEA and the school district. A large part of the experience hinged on onboarding teachers and subsequently onboarding their students. In order to do this with minimal friction, it was essential for teachers to be able to get their class up-and-running as soon as possible. This meant having all of their students in MAP Accelerator from day one. The experience would need to be designed around this manual rostering process‚ÄîI‚Äôll dive into more detail on that in a bit.</p><h4>Primary & secondary research</h4><p>With Khan Academy‚Äôs reach, we were able to line up school visits immediately. We started by doing field research at a public school in inner-city Chicago where a teacher was diligently using MAP test data to manually assign content in Khan Academy for each student. While laborious, this teacher said it was really effective in helping him differentiate each one of his students. We also ran co-design and participatory design sessions with teachers and students to help give us additional information while we were there.</p><p>Around the same time, we began outlining the technical steps for rostering and the onboarding experience teachers would have. This work led us to create a high-level journey map of the experience for district leaders, teachers and students. We knew there would be a lot of behind-the-scenes sequencing of steps that would lead to a choreography of these unique user roles, especially as it related to onboarding new users.</p><p>Lastly, we conducted some secondary research through conference proceedings at ISTE, books, journals and blogs around personalized education. What matters most to teachers when they look for personalized edtech supplements in the classroom? This led us down a path of looking into how teachers use competitor software from Pearson, IXL and the like to integrate with test score data.</p><section class='image-block'><figure><img src='/images/thappypath.png'/><figcaption>High-level journey map of the desired teacher experience.</figcaption></figure></section><h4>Findings</h4><p>Through both the primary and secondary research we uncovered that teachers tend to conduct class with math instruction in three main ways:</p><ol class='inner-content'><li>Teaching the whole class from a single lesson plan</li><li>Putting small groups of students together who are at a similar level and giving them unique assignments</li><li>Assigning personalized practice on an edtech supplement like Khan Academy</li></ol><p>With this research and our technical infrastructure, we blocked out the experience into a few major components:</p><ol class='inner-content'><li>Rostering & onboarding</li><li>Placement & assigning content</li><li>Reporting & adjusting placement</li></ol><p>You can see these specific steps in more detail on the following user flow.</p><section class='image-block'><figure><a href='/images/MGA.png'><img src='/images/MGA.png'/></a><figcaption>End-to-end user flow for MAP Accelerator (click for greater detail).</figcaption></figure></section><h4>Iterating on prototypes</h4><p>Armed with this high-level flow, we could now begin iterating on specifics with teachers. Placement emerged as a crucial part of the onboarding experience. In the Placement phase, a teacher would be able to see the student‚Äôs MAP score in an instructional area from their most recent test and assign Khan Academy content that is associated with that score range. This step would happen in tandem with rostering. Upon placing a student, the teacher would then be able to view a report that gives a high level overview of where each student is at with respect to each instructional area in Math. We sketched out numerous versions of this report and hopped on video calls with teachers around the country.</p><p>Here are some of the approaches we tried:</p><section class='image-block'><figure><img src='/images/mga-map-report-1.png'/></a><figcaption>Low-fidelity wireframe of a consolidated view of teacher reports.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src='/images/mga-map-report-2.png'/></a><figcaption>Low-fidelity wireframe of a more focused view of the placement scores.</figcaption></figure></section><p>We learned from teachers that they wanted to get a sense of progress in tandem with where their students placed. This information would help them learn if a student was working on material that was too easy or too challenging. This also gave them more insight when they wanted to group similar students together for small group activities.</p><p>After this learning phase, we dove in head first into an Agile process to begin implementing designs. While we were comfortable with the user experience that we wanted to have for our MVP, our timelines brought forth some compromises to the rostering and placement flows that were core to teacher onboarding.</p><h4>Shipped work</h4><p>We ended up shipping an entirely new product that included the ability for not only districts to easily roster classrooms and connect them to Khan Academy but for teachers to easily place students at their learning edge and monitor their progress accordingly. We called this the placement, practice, progress feedback loop. Our hypothesis was that this feedback loop, if properly instrumented, would help students achieve their full potential by consistently placing them at their learning edge and solving for the one-size-fits-all challenges teachers face when instructing a group of wildly different students. Here are some of the experiences we designed for:</p><section class='jumbo'><div class='img-container'><img src='/images/map-placement-flow.gif' /></div><div class='detail'><p>Walkthrough of the placement experience. When new MAP scores arrive, the experience prompts a teacher to review and place their students.</p><p>The MAP test is administered three times per year, so teachers will go through this process after each test.</p></div></section><section class='jumbo'><div class='img-container'><img src='/images/map-progress-report.png' /></div><div class='detail'><p>With the progress reports, a teacher could hone in on a specific time period and monitor how their students were progressing in each instructional area as defined by MAP.</p></div></section><section class='jumbo'><div class='img-container'><img src='/images/map-indie-student-report.png' /></div><div class='detail'><p>Teachers have a window into every student's unique needs.</p><p>On the individual student report, our MVP entailed a simple audit trail of tasks and activities done in the platform so teachers could get an overview of student effort.</p></div></section>";
  res.locals.outcomeNextSteps = "<p>MAP Accelerator launched its first pilot to 6 school districts in the Fall of 2019 to over 200 thousand students. That said, as an enterprise product, we had to develop different metrics for success from what we‚Äôre traditionally used to. Instead of indexing high on total users, we decided to place greater weight on the student activation rate and how many new students would become Monthly Very Active Learners (MVALs). MVALs include students who spend at least 120 minutes doing active learning on MAP Accelerator a month. Our target? 22% of licensed students. Our result? 23%. Overall, the pilot hit our success criteria giving us enough momentum to continue building on to the platform.</p><p>Like most times when we try something new, we learn something new. Working on this project definitely shed light on some growth opportunities for the organization and me!</p><p><strong>Lesson 1: 2 non-profits can bite off more than they can chew</strong></p><p>I think we were a bit over ambitious in terms of what we can accomplish and the realities of our resourcing capabilities.

One of the ways teachers in the classroom have learned to combat this is to apply a pedagogical pattern known as spiral review. The general idea is that concepts previously learned are later reinforced to help learners commit those concepts to long-term memory.</p><p>In Khan Academy, we realized we had developed a gap in our pedagogical approach.

  res.locals.processSolution = "<p>The idea of launching a spiral review feature came at a delicate time for Khan Academy. We were in the midst of deprecating an outdated, but beloved feature known as Missions that had a small, but vocal user base. Through interviewing many of these users, we understood that one of the main reasons they loved Missions was because of its ability for students to review material they had previously seen before. This form of space repetition, while not perfect, was a huge help for teachers using our platform. We also interviewed teachers who had once tried Khan Academy and abandoned it. Many of these users indicated that the primary reason they were less inclined to rely on Khan Academy was due to their class being unable to consistently review content from earlier subjects. Both of these teachers had concerns that their students wouldn‚Äôt be able to retain what they were learning on Khan Academy without consistent review.</p><blockquote><p>The elimination of spiraling‚Ä¶is the primary reason our schools switched from Khan‚Ä¶. Khan is just much less effective for our needs this way.</p><footer>‚Äî District Leader</footer></blockquote><blockquote><p>‚Ä¶this year my honors students only saw a 5% gain over their prior year ranking. I suspect this decrease is largely attributable to recent changes in KA. Specifically, lack of Spiral Review‚Ä¶</p><footer>‚Äî Teacher</footer></blockquote><p>Through our research we identified 3 goals:</p><ol class='inner-content'><li>Boost learner knowledge retention over time, and increase teacher confidence in our Course Mastery system by introducing a spiraling feature that was personalized to the learner</li><li>Give learners a less-punitive place to review and level up their skills. Currently, there are only a few ways to show you‚Äôve mastered a skill, and those are quite time-consuming for learners!</li><li>Encourage review of previously mastered skills. Our system previously had no mechanism to review skills students had already achieved mastery with.</li></ol><h4>Iterating on prototypes</h4><p>Having the green light on this feature set the stage for a few explorations. Our first approach involved incorporating ‚Äúflashback‚Äù questions in new quizzes and unit tests that learners would take on the platform. After a few iterations on this concept, cross-functional discussions and interviews with teachers, we realized this approach wouldn‚Äôt work for a few key reasons. To start, having these flashback questions interspersed within existing quizzes and unit tests meant that teachers lacked visibility into the black box of our personalized learning platform. As a result, the skills and specific questions students addressed wouldn‚Äôt be visible to a teacher so they‚Äôd have no way to intervene and help reinforce concepts. Teachers and our pedagogy working group also felt that having these review questions tacked on to existing quizzes and unit tests wouldn‚Äôt allow for sufficient review to help with knowledge retention. On top of that, having questions embedded in other quizzes and unit tests meant increased complexity for our engineering team as opposed to having a standalone review feature, especially when it came down to showing this data on teacher reports. My team and I ended up taking this feedback and iterating on the design of a standalone module for spiral review called Mastery Challenges.</p><section class='image-block'><figure><img src='/images/sr-question.png'/><figcaption>Our first approach at incorporating spiral review questions, which was unsuccessful.</figcaption></figure></section><h4>Shipped work</h4><p>After a student spends some time working on a course, they would ‚Äúunlock‚Äù a 6-question Mastery Challenge that spirals skills they have previously worked on. In order to do this, a learner would have to work on at least 3 skills in the course, 1 of which that they are ready to prove mastery on. The skills would be selected by our underlying system based on a student‚Äôs level of proficiency and the amount of time that‚Äôs elapsed since they last worked on that skill. Once a Mastery Challenge is unlocked, the student would have 12 hours to complete it before it resets. Having a time element on a Mastery Challenge ensures that the reviewed skills are always relevant (and adds a little gamification to the mix).</p.<p>On the teacher side of the experience, this item would show up as a unique entry on a student‚Äôs activity log. Teachers would be able to see the specific skills a student worked on and whether or not they leveled up in mastery.
