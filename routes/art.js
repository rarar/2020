The negative space serves to accentuate the simple gestures from the motors within each piece. The end result is an effort to make the attention economy physical. Functionally, each sculpture is equipped with scanning capabilities to detect the number of connected personal devices (smartphones, wearables, etc.). Increasing counts of detected devices cause each sculpture to operate more erratically and chaotically as a way of relating to the increased anxiety one feels with prolonged technology usage.</p>";
